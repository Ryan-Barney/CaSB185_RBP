A myriad of cellular mechanisms are responsible for the proper post-transcriptional processing of RNA. 
The ADAR1 family of proteins create a large variety of transcripts by mediating RNA editing, the process of modifying RNA transcripts by inserting, deleting, and/or substituting RNA nucleotides. 
ADAR1 specifically facilitates adenine-to-inosine (A-to-I) editing, one of the most common forms of RNA editing. 
Certain sites are subject to more or less editing than others. 
This differential RNA editing has been associated with various diseases, and investigating significant RNA editing sites can provide insight into RNA editing and its mechanisms. 
Here, we examine the role ADAR1 has in RNA editing in U87MG cells, a human glioblastoma cell line. 
Using RNA-sequencing data, we identify a number of pathways associated with ADAR1 knockdown, including RNA binding and processing function. 
The identification of these pathways is consistent with ADAR1â€™s function in binding to and editing RNA and validates its significance in post-transcriptional regulation. 
RNA editing plays a significant role in many life-threatening medical conditions, and understanding the mechanism of this interaction is crucial to the prevention and treatment of such diseases. 
With our study, we hope to further the understanding of key proteins like ADAR1, which has important clinical implications for future research.
